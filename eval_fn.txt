How the eval function is utilized:
The eval function calculates the ideal depth limit by accepting the game state object
and max_depth. We than calculate the red_count and blue_count of the marbles in the piles
and than measure the max score potential and depending on how many points are available are in the game
we with return with a deep or shadow depth. The more points that are available the deeper the depth, 
the less points the less deep the depth.
